DIY Raspberry Pi Gaming Console

Hey there! This is my Hack Club Blueprint Project: A Raspberry Pi 4 retro game emulator!
What’s This About?

I designed a portable gaming console powered by a Raspberry Pi 4. It plays classic games, and fits into a custom case I made myself.

Stuff I used:

- [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B – 4GB RAM](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4296?src=raspberrypi)
- MicroSD card (32GB or more) - (https://a.co/d/2FR91AR)
- Screen (3.5") - (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WQW6H9S)
- Power supply - any powerbank (wired)
- Controller/Keyboard - (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07STY21PS)
- Optional: heatsinks, fan, Wi-Fi dongle

Software Setup

1. Flash a retro game emulator OS (Ex: RetroPie) onto your SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager.
2. Boot up the Pi and configure your controller.
3. Use



Final Thoughts

This was super fun to build and even more fun to play! Blueprint is epic!
