## 10/17/2025 - Pushed my BOM.csv and README.md  

I made my Bill of Materials and README.md. I plan on working on my case next in use fusion 360 for my case. I think I'm going to finish this soon hopefully and I might add upgrades to the consoles like a speaker and a better screen. I think I might also find a way to make the console handheld instead of a brick.
