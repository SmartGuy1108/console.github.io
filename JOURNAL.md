## 10/17/2025 8 PM - Pushed my BOM.csv and README.md  

I made my Bill of Materials and README.md. I plan on working on my case next in use fusion 360 for my case. I think I'm going to finish this soon hopefully and I might add upgrades to the consoles like a speaker and a better screen. I think I might also find a way to make the console handheld instead of a brick.

## 10/17/2025 9 PM - Updated BOM   

I found cheaper versions and updated my BOM. I improved the thickness of the console and i might make it handheld and attachable to tv and monitors. I am going to find better versions of the controllers and possibly find speakers. I think i could add a bigger sd card.  ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mjg4MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--33517b07327f42bed4f93146fcf89d62ab07d43b/image.png)
  

## 10/18/2025 - Updated BOM with sales tax and finished basic case  

I added sales tax to my BOM and finished my first version of the case which will hold the raspberry pi 4 the fan and the screen. I think I am almost done with the console and I think I can publish it soon. I am going to add a improved version of the case ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzIzMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8aef719ba4c85cfdbd49dd0362ee7af8ffdbdaaf/image.png)
   

## 10/19/2025 1 AM - Added vents to the case  

I added the ventilation holes to the case and my logo I will add the battery pack holder later. I have also finished the improved port cutouts and i improved the size and am planning on adding padding after the case is completed. I think I might be able to finish the case soon.![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzI1NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--951bdc8ef10d3e00c95b823e6faa420c77d6b17d/image.png)
  

## 10/19/2025 9 AM - Added the battery holder  

I added the battery pack holder and finished the case! (for now) I am planning on working on trying to find even cheaper parts to save more money. I can probably finish this soon and make it cheaper before I do. I might also try and see if there is anything I can add to the case.
